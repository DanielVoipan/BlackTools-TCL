Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------

**** MULTI-CHANNEL SUPPORT
-- Intelligent IRC channel management, every channel manager can now customise this 
   script and its component settings to his liking (add/remove users, activate or 
   disable desired commands, protections or modules).

**** FLEXIBILE AND EASY OF USE
-- Now 100% flexible to be configured via channel.
---- Possibility of being able to modify, directly into the eggdrop config file
     (eggdrop.conf) without having to log on to the shell machine to do that.
     (i.e. nickname, realname, homechan, chanserv, chanserv username, chanserv
     password, etc.)
---- All the warn/kick/ban reasons are highly customizable. 
---- Every channel manager can set different settings for each channel, add or 
     remove anything as want easily.

-- A new and better version of ANUNT/ADVERT module that will display, one by one
   in order, announcements/ads on a channel over a certain amount of time, but ONLY
   if the channel is active.

-- This new autoinvite, is a new personal channel setting, the first of it's kind. 
---- When turned on and banned, this engine makes the eggdrop to remove your ban and
     invite you to that channel, saving you the trouble of doing by yourself.

**** AUTOTOPIC
-- This new autotopic makes your eggdrop to reset the topic to the channel TOPIC and
   URL every time is changed by someone.
---- If the channel is idle, the topic will not be reset during that time
     (idle = no users joining).
---- The old topic module was removed from this version with all system functions,
     except the '.r' command for refreshing topic manually.

**** BACKCHAN 
-- This system is the old well-known ChanReport system but now renamed in BackChan
   and in a new and better version.

     in which eggdrop will say the bans given by him to the mainchannel..

-- The new badchan system will perform scans not only on users are joining channels,
   but also while they are still on the channel where badchan is enabled.

   specified bad words. 
---- This new system module supports wildcards.

   which performs accurate and efficient searches through global banlist and every
   channel banlists for a better management and an easier removal/unban.

-- A new system module that will allow the eggdrop to keep statistics of each kick
   and ban given on a specified channel.

**** CHANLINK

     simultaneously to all other channels and vice versa.

   code for each user who joins the channel, which needs to be confirmed only once
   (first time join) if they wish to be allowed to join in the channel.

     the unique code for each user who joins the channel and every time re-joins, which
     needs to be confirmed every time.
